# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is functional and secure is to ensure that I am constantly testing the sections of code I create so that no new errors are being introduced.  The best way to start is to simply periodically use the IDE's compiler to check for any syntax errors in the new code. As I continue developing different components, I will also be creating tests for them to ensure that the component outputs the expected output based on the given input.  As changes are made to components tests must also be adapted and or retested to ensure that the quality of the component has not changed. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The best way I have found to interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program is to first break down the needs into groups based on what type of component they would be related too (Ex: Multiple users are going to be able to have an account with X number of similar traits so I would create a class component).  After doing this with all the needs listed by the user, I will then possibly pseudo-code any other features that the user would like in the system to be added later.  Once coding of these features is complete, I will also do testing of the system to ensure that what the user wants is working properly and all features are implemented. 

# How do I approach designing software?

What I found to work for me during this course is to do what I described above, where I start with grouping the related features of what the user needs in the system.  Once this is done,  I would then add in other features that would also be needed for some functionality to be obtainable.  Once all that is planned, I would then go through and create a graph of the flow of decisions made in functions to ensure that the flow makes sense and gives the desired result.  This is where test cases are made to do an initial test of what is to be added will produce the desired output and can be retested once it has been developed to ensure that the output is the same as before.
